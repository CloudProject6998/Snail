How to deploy our software:
Under the package Project/Snail/app/build/outputs/apk, there is a app-release-unaligned.apk, which can be installed on Android mobile phone 
with version 4.4.2

Different parts of our code:
1) com.example.westsnow.myapplication: 

Files under this directory shows the front side of our application. Each class represents a page, with a corresponding configuration xml file
under directory res, including classes: MainActivity, Register, PersonalPage, HomePage, SendMoment, SendText, TimeLine, TimeLineAdapter and 
CustomListAdapter. 
- MainActivity.java is the first page where user can login in to personal page. 
- Register.java is a register page. 
- PersonalPage.java is the page to show google map and track user's routes, and show the user's friends' routes on google map.
- HomePage.java is the page to show the user's friends lists.
- SendMoment.java is the page to send user's photos to moments

- Constant.java stores constants
- JsonParser.java to parse json data
- dbUtil.java to connect RDS on AWS
- MapUtil.java to provides help functions to show google map
- CurLocaTracker.java to track user's current location and show it on google map
- LocaChangeTracker.java to add location and gps listener and track changes of user's current location
- Route.java to implement recommendation algorithm of best routes 
- SnailException.java to show Snail specific exceptions


3) com.example.westsnow.unittest

In unittest package, we implement unit test on different components
- TestFindPos.java to test if can find a position according to user's provided location name using google direction API
- TestMaps.java to test if map can be shown correctly
